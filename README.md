# Vim syntax plugin for liberty (*.lib) files

This repository holds a copy of the syntax files maintained by [Peter Debacker (imec)](https://github.com/peter-d/dotfiles/blob/master/.vim/syntax/) as part of his Vim configuration.

The files are organized into `syntax`/`ftpdetect`/... directories so you can easily install them using a plugin manager (like [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) or [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)).
